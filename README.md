LM Project: Building a News Research Tool In the age of digital media, misinformation and biased reporting have become significant challenges. A News Research Tool powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) can help users analyze news articles, verify sources, and extract key insights efficiently.
News Summarization – Generates concise summaries of articles while retaining key details.
Fact-Checking Assistance – Cross-references claims with verified databases to assess credibility.
Sentiment & Bias Analysis – Identifies the tone and potential bias in news articles.
Named Entity Recognition (NER) – Extracts key entities such as people, places, and organizations.
Trend Analysis – Tracks evolving topics by analyzing multiple sources. Implementation Steps:
Dataset Collection – Gather a diverse dataset of news articles, fact-check reports, and misinformation examples.
Preprocessing – Clean, tokenize, and structure the data for model training.
Fine-Tuning an LLM – Train the model on news-specific data to improve accuracy in summarization, sentiment analysis, and fact-checking.
Building an API/Web App – Deploy the model with an interactive user interface for accessibility.
Evaluation & Optimization – Continuously improve performance using user feedback and real-time updates. By leveraging AI-driven analysis, this tool can empower journalists, researchers, and general users to navigate news intelligently, detect biases, and stay informed with credible information.
